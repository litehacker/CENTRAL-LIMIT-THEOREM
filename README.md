# CENTRAL-LIMIT-THEOREM
CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM simple code in C
Dice are ideal for illustrating the central limit theorem. If you roll a six-sided die, the probability of rolling a one is 1/6, a two is 1/6, a three is also 1/6, etc. The probability of the die landing on any one side is equal to the probability of landing on any of the other five sides.
The central limit theorem states that for a large enough n, X-bar can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ/√n.
The population mean for a six-sided die is (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5.

The histograms for each set of averages show that as the sample size, or number of rolls, increases, the distribution of the averages comes closer to resembling a normal distribution. In addition, the variation of the sample means decreases as the sample size increases.
